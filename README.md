# VideohubRoutingCli

Description

VideohubRoutingCli is a small Cli Program to remotely control BMD Videohub. This is a revamp of the former project VideohubRouterCli.

Goal is to make it so that routings from known devices can be saved and loaded with one command instead of having to set every single connection.

As of now, the tool is not yet very functional, as i am working on it in my free time and am learning a lot about programming in C++.

Future features
  - Adding/removing devices to local database
  - Saving/loading routings
  - renaming channels
  - locking channels
  - GUI with a matrix like interface (e.g. Dante interface; top: Sources, left: Destinations)
